# Day-Planner
<h2>Description</h2>
This planner application is framed for the scheduling of an average work day, 9am to 5pm. 
<h2>Usage</h2>
This application allows you to write text to any hour block and save the text to your local storage for daily reference.

Background styling classes are added to each time block depending on the time of day. 
As time passes, the hour past turns gray, the current hour block will turn red, and for all of the time blocks following the current hour, they will be green.

<h3>Hourly Color Coding</h3>
